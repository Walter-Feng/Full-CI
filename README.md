# Full-CI

This is a practice from Chan's group (https://github.com/gkclab/pickle). 
It contains two algorithms: direct Full-CI hamiltonian construction, and Knowles-Handy's algorithm using the one-particle excitation matrix.
A simple Davidson diagonalization scheme is also used.

Good starting project! I enjoyed it.
